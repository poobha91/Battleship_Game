Battleship game in JAVA
Java is a popular high-level programming language Sun Microsystems (now Oracle) developed in the mid-1990s. Java was designed to be platform-independent, meaning it can run on any platform or operating system that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed. Java is widely used for developing various types of applications, including web applications, desktop applications, mobile apps, and games.

In this assignment, we have created the program with the use of MVC architecture, global variables, class and objects, array, conditional statements, looping, exception handling, and encapsulations. We use IntelliJ IDEA Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for this Java development. 

The purpose of this program is to build a battleship game, which allows the player to place their ships on the battlefield and destroy opponentsâ€™ ships by choosing the coordinates in the form of numbers from the field. The game was built to be user-friendly and easy to play, with the ability to handle wrong inputs by players unintentionally or intentionally and highlight them to the player to correct them.
